**Although we were planning to hold our annual leadership election this month, the elections team received only two nominations for leadership roles and neither nominee wanted to commit to running as a co-lead. As a result, we're unable to hold an election for brigade leadership, per our bylaws. The Steering Committee is now working on a contingency plan to address short-term operational needs and long-term structural improvements.**

March's focus was on updating the Steering Committee on the current lack of leadership nominees and the implications for brigade operations:

- Our bylaws require co-leads to be elected by general membership.
- Temporary vacancies may be appointed by a Steering Committee vote but this doesn't solve the failure to hold a general membership election.

The fundamental need is a process for reevaluating the brigade's core purpose and activities, addressing the engagement issue, and revising the brigade structure and governance represented in the bylaws to hopefully mitigate the risk of this situation happening again. Since that will be a significant effort, we need a short-term plan to address what happens during that process.

### Approaches for resolving the lack of leadership

- **Pause mode:** Negotiate with Code for America to hold our funds (about $10k) and IP for a limited time, temporarily suspend operations (no meetups, no project work), and develop a process to reevaluate the brigade's core purpose and activities, address the engagement issue, and revise the brigade structure and governance represented in the bylaws.
- **Lean Ops mode:** Divide the core [operational tasks]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11r1jlQmfpU4YQpnVYydcmRgaiJAmW8t33Ku5DHBjoPA/edit?usp=sharing) required for minimum functionality amongst Steering Committee members (and any other volunteers interested in helping).
- **Shutting down the brigade**.

Everyone agreed we didn't want to shut down the brigade if a viable alternative could be found. But lean mode essentially means abdicating the membership election required by the bylaws, so we took a quick temperature check to determine how comfortable people were with this. The vote was split, with 4 of 7 committee members indicating they objected to the idea.

### Concerns about Pause mode
- Some members wanted to ensure that projects could continue even if we had to pause operations in the absence of leadership.
- Some members were concerned that pausing operations completely would make it harder to restart once a new structure and leadership was in place.

### Concerns about Lean Ops mode

- Finding people willing to serve temporarily is likely to be as much of a challenge as finding election nominees.
- There is a desire to appoint someone to at least sign the Code for America MOU (required to be a brigade), in order to hold onto the existing funds in our accounts (approx. $10k). This would need to be negotiated with Code for America.
- One member was concerned about the lack of accountability if projects continued while brigade operations and oversight were paused.

After a short period of breakout discussions, it was clear we needed more time to determine if Lean Ops mode was even a viable option (would we be able to find enough support even for those tasks?). We scheduled a follow-up emergency Steering Committee meeting for the following week.

### Covering Lean Ops tasks

The March 29 follow-up meeting was focused on sorting and assigning operational tasks:

1. Outgoing co-leads shared a list of baseline operational tasks
2. Steering Committee reviewed them together and aligned on which were functional requirements, which were "lean," and which were "nice to have."
3. Members volunteered to cover the tasks they were willing to take on.

Ultimately, we determined that Steering Committee would be able to temporarily manage a Leans Ops mode, particularly if we moved to a reduced meeting schedule.

### Putting it to a membership vote







### Context

**How did this happen?**
There are many factors contributing to reduced member engagement  over the past several years: lack of brigade processes and infrastructure, lack of project management support and structure, problematic treatment of BIPOC and other historically marginalized members, and pandemic exhaustion and competing volunteer opportunities.

**Can I have more details before Tuesday?**
Yes! You can read the summary deck shared with SC and the full meeting minutes. Please drop a note in #oo-steering-committee with any questions, comments, or thoughts. We want to hear from you!

**Can I come to Tuesday’s special SC meeting?**
Yes! You can attend as an observer. We will have an open comment period in which you can share whatever you’d like (there will be a 2-minute time limit per speaker, a la City Council). You are welcome to submit written feedback in addition to/instead of live comments (steering@openoakland.org or in #oo-steering-committee). We want to hear from you!
