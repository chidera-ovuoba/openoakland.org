OpenOakland bridges technology and community for a thriving and equitable Oakland. We do this by:

- **Cultivating meaningful relationships.**  
    By partnering with the city and the community we foster a more inclusive, equitable, and engaged Oakland.

- **Inspiring civic engagement.**  
    We co-create tools and events that educate Oaklanders on how the city works and inspires them to effect civic change.

- **Empowering Oaklanders.**  
    We recognize that Oakland has a rich history of activism. We seek to empower all Oaklanders to keep advocating for our communityâ€˜s collective well-being.

## Part of the Code for America network

We're a fiscally-sponsored project of [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), a 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to improving government in meaningful ways. [Donations to OpenOakland](https://www.codeforamerica.org/donate-to-a-brigade?utm_campaign=Open%20Oakland&utm_source=OpenOakland%20site) are tax-deductible through Code for America (be sure to select OpenOakland from the drop-down menu after choosing the amount).

## How we work

Brigade membership is open to all, regardless of expertise or skill level. The brigade is led by a core team of elected leads. These are generally members who have been actively engaged in OpenOakland activities for an extended period of time. Activities and formal decision-making are overseen by a Steering Committee, which meets monthly and consists of the elected leads plus project representatives.

### 2021 Co-leads

{% include steering-committee.html %}

If you're interested in joining the leadership team, join us for Hack Night and introduce yourself. In the interest of greater representation, our Communications Lead has committed to sharing or turning the role over if you're interested and identify as Black, Indigenous, or a person of color (reach out in #oo-steering-committee if interested).


## How you can get involved

    Every Tuesday from 6:30-9:00pm PST, we meet on Zoom (normally, we meet in City Hall but are working remotely during the coronavirus pandemic). After intros on Zoom, we break off into Slack channels to work and you can bounce around to introduce yourself. Don't be shy about joining in; we're friendly folk. [RSVP on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/).
