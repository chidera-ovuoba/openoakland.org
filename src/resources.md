The [Exploration Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing) is designed to help project teams tackle real needs in the community, ensure impacted voices are reflected in project design, and explore potential unintended consequences. All projects must submit a Project Brief for Steering Committee approval to become an OpenOakland project.
