OpenOakland is unable to hold an election for 2022 brigade leadership due to a lack of nominees/volunteers. Given this, the Steering Committee is currently comprised of all active project leads, without any representation elected by membership. Per our bylaws, we are committed to a democratically-controlled brigade that ensures all members have a direct voice in how we operate. More details are available in our [March Steering Committee Recap](/updates/mar-2022-steering-committee-update/).

This vote would empower the current Steering Committee to:

- Maintain brigade status with Code for America in the absence of elected member representation.
- Revise the bylaws with the aim of improving participation and more diverse representation.
- Host events and meetings to serve the above purposes.

[Place your vote before May 17](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfqgSuf9ICxGAohP2-7Zam1zHwN0qCMnSW5ALHg6nyCa7f5w/viewform){: .btn .btn-primary }  


_Voting is open to all OpenOakland attendees and contributors within the past year. Steering Committee members are not eligible to vote. Voting closes at 6pm PT on Tuesday, May 17._
