OpenOakland subscribes to Code for America's [tenet](https://www.codeforamerica.org/values) that _no one is coming; it's up to us_. We strive for consensus as much as possible and are continually working to build a collaborative community where members have the flexibility to lean into action, while maintaining accountability to each other and our broader Oakland community.

## Brigade structure

Brigade membership is open to all, regardless of expertise or skill level. We have a core team of elected representatives (known as Elects), supported by a Steering Committee that oversees activities and formal decision-making. The Steering Committee consists of the elected leads plus project representatives.

The brigade has two Ombudspeople (available at [safespace@openoakland.org](mailto:safespace@openoakland.org)), who are available to anyone who wishes to provide feedback, express concerns, report a Code of Conduct violation, or otherwise seek support. Ombudspeople are independent of the Steering Committee.


### How the Steering Committee works

The Steering Committee follows a set of [bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QR-fr1WnmXkZoVNmWnZ9drzfmaZoPkodEOx-PkExt94/) that outline leadership roles, project requirements, decision-making processes, and additional brigade policies. _All OpenOakland members are welcome to sit in on the committee's monthly meetings._
