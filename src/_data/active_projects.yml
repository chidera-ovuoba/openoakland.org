The migration focused primarily on moving the codebase, and we now are working on improving site architecture and visual design. Issues in GutHub marked "Good First Issue" are great for first-timers.

Our initial effort is focused on a volunteer-friendly database for WOEIP staff and volunteers to manage and explore the local AQ data they collect through the organization’s citizen science program. We’ll then build on this to create a neighborhood-friendly platform that allows residents to act on this data through self-education, self-empowerment, and civic engagement.
